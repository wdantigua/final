        <p> 5 CG professionals talk navigating the field post graduation </p>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <p> Approximately 4.5 million students put on their cap and gown and walk up the stage to pick up their diploma. 2 million of those are Bachelor students who for the first time will venture outside the safety of their respective educational
            institutions and join the workforce of their chosen careers. Each of those students, a new lightbulb to contribute to the progress of their chosen fields.
        </p>
        <p>many of these students will march forward with no support of their own on where to even begin. Unless they have a family history of generations in their chosen field or were able to make meaningful connections during their internship
            opportunities, many of them will most likely not have interacted with more senior professionals that can mentor them through the rocky world of post graduation life.</p>

        <p>This is a report on the story of 5 computer graphics professionals and their advice to the budding generation of CG artists. They talk on the anecdotes of how they got started, the struggles that they faced after graduation and what one
            could expect when walking into the cg world.</p>

        <p>these 5 experts came from diverse backgrounds and times. Amanda, a junior lighter at Nickelodeon fresh from graduation. Levi, another junior specialist experienced in CG from early childhood. Nino, a senior professor teaching CG since
            1996. Jason, a senior Producer with the experience of having managed a vast number of 3D graphics teams. Finally, Camilo, a senior 3D artist in SF with years of experience under his belt.</p>
