            <h3>What steps did you take to get started in the workforce after graduation?</h3>
            <p> When I started looking for jobs I’d send 10-20 applications a day. I did apply to every tiny place, even when they were not looking for people I’d still send my portfolio and told them hey this is what I can do if you have any
                available jobs or something like that at the beginning basically be prepared cuz you’re not gonna do exactly what you wanted so that’s part of the process so yeah I think like somebody gave me a data map resources. I made a google
                document of all the places I applied. But yeah be very open. Your chances are gonna be higher in smaller company cuz they tend to look for junior people. That’s a great place to start and get to know what parts you like more
            </p>


            <h3>Is there anything you wish you knew before starting?</h3>

            <p> That’s really complicated you realize that you really don’t know much as you should, that’s very cliche but you realize you don’t know anything. So that’s gonna be the case. I’ll say that there’s no, to me, of course everyone has a
                different path, in terms of like, but to me not talking from my own experience, but from friends in school. You need to be super prepared, because there’s so many people trying to get the same job, I always recommend people to learn
                multiple skills specially in video games once for example production finishes companies will let you go. So you wanna be the person that is able to move between departments. I think it’s also super important that you show you have
                some opinion and style about the art. I think it’s definitely be prepared to not just do one aspect of CG but also to move between different directions.
            </p>
            <h3> Do you feel that youre often put in a position where you learn more in the job than while in school?
            </h3>
            <p> That’s always the case where you often learn more in the job. It’s sort of like once you’re working, specially in my case from where I work there’s no one guiding me in that regard in what I need to do, so basically there’s a lot of
                trying to figure out on your own jump and try things and constantly try to fill that space. And it’s very different than a school assignment cuz it feels so personal. But at work everyone wants something different so you’re trying to
                give the best work that expresses who you are and trying to understand what other people needs are. But don’t worry about those things right now just enjoy the process. You feel like you’re not learning eanything but it’s little by
                little after you look back and then you’re like wow I did change a lot and I did grew a lot bit it’s hard to see it while you’re working, but don’t expect it to happen in a month.
            </p>
            <h3> What you feel best prepared you working of the field of CG?
            </h3>
            <p> Definitely drawing I feel that’s a huge part of what I do drawing is in everything. And also being able to communicate, one thing is to communicate in words but when you communicate with drawing it makes a big different it also makes
                you understand design to understand color shape how to intérpret it. I really encourage it. In my expereince everyone is worried about coming to the field and not knowing it well but that’s always gonna be the case so you might as
                well do something even small doodles. In order to communicate with the team better but also with developing your eye specially in 3D everyone is just focused on the software
            </p>
            <h3> What aspect of your job do you find the most challenging?
            </h3>
            <p>This is always gonna be the case at least from my side is communication with game designers. First of all that’s a different way of thinking, but second it always comes to the code all the scripting that they do and then of course
                there are many things I don’t understand about coding it’s super challenging for me to just try to figure out what they’re trying to do sometimes I don’t even know what’s going on with the animation but it’s more related to the code
                and the way that they decide to build the code. And when </p>
