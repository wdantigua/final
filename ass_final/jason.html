            <h3>What can i expect about the realities of working in the game industry?</h3>
            <p>Honestly? For most of us, the reality is long hours, low pay and little recognition. But you do what you love! And over time it gets better. </p>
            <h3>How did your career path lead you to working at Bethesda? </h3>
            <p>The long way. Out of college I worked as a games journalist, then when the bottom dropped out of the internet advertising market, I had to get a day job. I kept writing about games, and hoped to go full-time again. In 2004 I finally
                made that happen by going to work at Rockstar in PR. I liked PR, but I really wanted to work in production, and made that clear to management. When the 2K Games division started up, I was given my opportunity to make that happen. But
                then they decided to merge 2K NY with 2K in California, so my choices were to move or lose my job. I moved, under a two year contract. After two years it was clear to my wife and I that we just weren't California people, so I poked
                some of my industry contacts on the east coast, and my timing was perfect, as Bethesda needed someone to produce Fallout New Vegas, which was my dream project, and I'd known Todd Howard since my days as a journalist. I've been here
                ever since. </p>
            <h3>As a producer overseeing large creative projects have you had the opportunity to manage more junior creative teams? what are some of the most common pitfalls you've encountered from the part of the creative teams that you wish more
                junior talent should prepare for when starting in the industry?</h3>
            <p>Generally I work with experienced people. Sometimes there are younger devs involved, but I've been fortunate to work with (and learn from) some of the best people in this industry, from Sid Meier to Ken Levine to Todd Howard. The
                biggest mistake junior devs make is they always assume they know how a project is going to turn out when they start. That's never true. No game is ever exactly what you think it's going to be. Some times you get close, but more often
                than not you need to go where the gameplay leads you. Sticking to a plan because you made it on day one is stupid. No game is designed on paper. </p>
            <h3>Is there anything you wished you knew before entering the field?</h3>
            <p>Honestly? No. I've made a lot of mistakes, but they've made me who I am. Maybe that I wouldn't get to stay in NY. I turned down a job at Blizzard because I didn't want to move to California. A year later I moved to California anyway.
                :)
                What else do you think I need to know in order to make a good decision about working in Game Development?
                The golden rule: don't be a jerk. The industry is SO SMALL. You have no idea. Random people cross paths all the time, and you hear stories. Be nice to everyone, and assume you'll be working for them some day. Or an accurate one from
                my own life: work every day like your coworker will write a tell-all about your company some day. </p>
            <h3>Iâ€™d really love to keep learning about the Game industry and how to be a part of it, is there anyone else you can suggest that I talk to?</h3>
            <p>Not off the top of my head, but keep reaching out to people! Introduce yourself to folks at trade shows. You never know who's going to give you invaluable advice. </p>
