            <h3>What experiences you feel best prepared you for working in the field of CG? </h3>

            <p>My senior year/thesis is what prepped me the most for working in this industry. Not only did it push me to learn new skill sets that I didn't think i was capable of, but it also made me more confident in my ability to pick up new
                programs/workflows quickly which is a vital skill going into any professional job. I was also lucky to have my film reach larger platforms such as CG Meetup, CG Bros, and numerous adoption websites so it helped me grow my
                professional
                network and credibility as an artist.</p>

            <h3> Is there anything you wished you knew before entering the Industry?</h3>
            <p>I feel like my school prepped me pretty well for the industry as all of my professors were active working professionals from numerous studios around the city, so I can't speak to anything specifically. The only thing that was a little
                surprising was that most work days don't end til 7, and a lot of studios enforce mandatory overtime due to the fast paced turn around of the industry. There are a few smaller studios that run 10-6 or 9-5 but they're definitely far
                and
                few in between.</p>

            <h3>What can i expect about the realities of working in the field?</h3>

            <p>You're entering as a junior/intern. The tasks you'll receive in the beginning will be fairly simple, and in some instances, you may be treated like an assistant to the CG Lead before taking on higher priority work and getting to prove
                yourself as an artist. For instance, I want to specialize in CG Lighting, but I started out as a layout intern and was handed a few simple lighting shots towards the end. Certain skills, like lighting & rendering, are very dependent
                on
                the studio's pipeline/render tools, so it made sense that I wasn't lighting immediately.</p>

            <h3>Expect to work late night sometimes -- especially if your team is approaching a deadline.</h3>

            <p>The culture of every studio is different. There's some places that you're gonna love the environment and your team, and you're going to have a great lead/director to report to and learn from. Unfortunately not every studio is like
                that
                though, so make sure you find a place that recognizes your potential and fosters your growth as an artist!</p>

            <h3>I noticed from your resume that you worked for Nickelodeon. I wonder what’s it like to work for a studio like that. what does your regular work day looks like?</h3>

            <p>Nickelodeon was a lot of fun! The times square facility was amazing. They made working there very comfortable by providing fancy coffee machines (for free), their own cafeteria for all Viacom workers with super cheap food, and plenty
                of
                big lounge spaces for monthly office parties. Also, because you're in a studio with other lines of business for Nick (social, toy design, etc) your hours are a normal 8 hour 10-6 workday. The cons are that the company is very
                corporate
                and you spend a lot of time going through several lines of people until finally reaching decisions/gaining information from the "higher ups".</p>

            <h3>If I look for an internship or job in this field, where would you suggest I look to get started in the industry?</h3>

            <p>To find an internship/job, I would google the studios/workplaces that interest you the most and just send your work to them! Connect however you can whether it's on LinkedIn or through your contacts at school. Once you land on, it
                becomes
                easier to make contacts and find the next. It really comes down to luck, good timing, who you know, and consistently putting yourself and your work out there.</p>

            <h3>I’d really love to keep learning about the CG industry and how to be a part of it, is there anyone else you can suggest that I talk to?</h3>

            <p>(Slightly adrift) I'm not sure if Parsons does this, but SVA would hold frequent panel talks with artists/directors/recruiters from all parts of the CG industry. If there's ever an opportunity to set something up like this, I would
                love
                to talk further on these topics and hold some sort of Q&A for students in your department!</p>
