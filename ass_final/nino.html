            <h3> Where did your interest for 3D graphics come from? How did you get started?</h3>

            <p>My interest in CGI developed almost by chance. I studied sculpture in undergrad and grad school. As an undergrad I did a lot of stone carving and ceramics work. In grad school mostly I made large site specific constructions using
                gypsum board metal studs and plaster. Working with construction materials allowed me to make a living as a carpenter after grad school. I became familiar with the use of CAD software in construction and when I bought my first
                computer in the early '90s, a Macintosh Quadra 660AV, one of the first packages I purchased was a 3D modeling and rendering application made by Pixar called Showplace. To say the package required patience to use would be an
                understatement. Making 3D art was about as taxing an activity as could be accomplished on a Mac at that time. Regardless, I got into it and eventually moved on to other packages and platforms. For years I used Softimage 3D on an SGI
                indigo2. Both software and hardware now consigned to ancient CGI history.</p>


            <h3>What aspect of the asset creation process you find your students mostly struggling in and why do you think so?</h3>

            <p>Different students struggle with different parts of the CG pipeline. Some have trouble managing files, some are fine with hard surface modeling but struggle with organic modeling, some have a hard time making rigs work predictably,
                etc. Generally, every student will pick up enough to get past basic problems and learn whatever they need to make the output they want for project. Not every student wants to render for photo-realistic animation, some just want
                assets they can use in a game authoring application, some want simple rendered elements for compositing.
                Thinking on it though, I'd say UV Editing and shader network creation remain the most challenging tasks for many students. UVs = pain, I know.</p>

            <h3>What are some of the skills that you see are most important when working in 3D? </h3>

            <p>In CG, as in any creative digital media activity, many important skills are plainly boring ones:

                Good Project management
                When developing a CG project you'll generate dozens to hundreds to thousands of files so it's important to establish and commit to a logical and consistent naming convention for everything.
                Your authoring package, like Maya, will have it's own Project folder hierarchy structure. Learn this and use it.

                Good scene management
                Name everything. Manage history. Freeze transforms. Keep different versions. Use file referencing. Use caching as appropriate, especially open source formats like alembic caches. Manage your caches.
                Think in terms of assets you can reuse from project to project.
                Learn to optimize your assets as much as possible, especially if you're working and sharing these with others. Get rid of anything in the scene you're not using anymore.

                Draw out your ideas
                Unless you're one of those blessed types who can think through their ideas from scratch in a 3D application, sketch out your concepts before you commit to actually modeling them. Maybe I'm old fashioned...
            </p>
            <h3>
                Where do you see the field going in the next 5/10 years in terms of emerging technologies and workflows?</h3>

            <p> You know, I don't think I'm really qualified to answer this question. The time-based forms I relate to the most - film, animation, even videos games - are all delivered through a display frame of one kind or another and they
                communicate to the viewer/user through conventions that are long established. The VR/AR pieces I've tried are interesting but I've yet to experience anything I would say truly excites me. That said, a while back, the BBC did a
                remarkable 360 degree multimedia piece on Venezuela's El Helicoide prison. The use of interactive technology to present the history of this awful place was actually very effective. I could see this tech being more widely adopted.
            </p>

            <h3> Are you aware of any communities or resources youâ€™d recommend to get more deeply involved in the CG community?</h3>

            <p>A established forum where you can ask questions and post work in progress is worth your time. The Maya forums on area.autodesk,com are good for tech questions and uploading work, the Pixar RenderMan forums are recommended as well.
                Look into rendering services like Google's Zinc to render your stills remotely. These services are becoming a mainstay of small CG studios. properly managed, they're cheaper than running an on site
