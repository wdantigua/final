            <h3> how did you develop your interest for CG?
            </h3>
            <p> I had an early interest in it when I was 14--I learned Maya then and learned Cinema 4D a year later. In college, doing more work outside of classes and doing research into the latest industry trends, as well as talking to people in
                the industry helped a lot. I also had a job at RIT as a 3D & motion graphics artist for the hockey team. Professors are good for teaching fundamentals, but you'll definitely want to reach out to people in the industry to see what
                sort of work you should make, as well as building connections.</p>
            <h3>What experiences you feel best prepared you for working in the field of CG?
            </h3>
            <p>Not much, really. I think having conversations and internships with my friends in the field prepared me very well. But I do know that a lot of students didn't quite understand the quality standard associated with making work in
                school, so sometimes they'll get overlooked in the job pool. I can definitely give you a hand with that if you'd</p> like.
            <h3>Is there anything you wished you knew before entering the Industry?</h3>
            <p>In terms of things to know, I'd say if you haven't already, learn to take critique and not challenge it. Sometimes it might sound a bit harsh at times, but it's always there to improve the quality standard of your work. Take
                initiative--if you have a skill you want to show off or an idea you want to come to fruition, put in the work to see it through. Be flexible in your position, and be humble, especially as a new artist. </p>
            <h3>What can i expect about the realities of working in the field?
            </h3>
            <p>the length of your work days will really vary depending on the company you go to. At Wayfair, I'm able to pretty much lead a 9 to 5 life, which is really nice considering that game studios and some film studios are known for very long
                work days (just look up the sort of hours that went into Life of Pi, Anthem or Red Dead Redemption 2).
            </p>

            <h3>If I look for an internship or job in this field, where would you suggest I look to get started in the industry?</h3>
            <p>I personally use Glassdoor mostly, though I get directly emailed from time to time about job opportunities. Turn on job alerts and apply ASAP when positions come up. My response rate tended to go up when I applied within the first day
                of the posting. Paid internships are better than unpaid, but use your best judgment to get position you want. When I interned at the Simpsons, I wasn't really paid enough to live there but the experience I gained was super valuable.
                Consider the area of CG you'd like to be in and go from there.</p>
            <h3>I never thought of a different industry to work for in CG other than film and games so it was surprising to see you found work at Wayfair. Im curious to know how your career path led you to working for Wayfair? and how is it
                different from what you expected while in school?</h3>
            <p>Yeah! Something I learned since I began working is to not assume too much about an industry until you have a job in it. CG is crazy expansive as a field and has some serious potential. I've seen job postings for everything from
                nonprofits to museum installation work. My personal goal in going to Wayfair was to become better versed in photorealism, since that's a key skill many companies like to see in new artists. When in school, professors tend to be out
                of the industry for some time, and can't always keep you updated on current practices. Knowing this, I focused a lot during my junior and senior on making work that was a bit more beyond what I was being taught. The more motivation
                you show in standing out from others, the better your odds are of getting a job out of school.</p>
            <h3> Iâ€™d really love to keep learning about the CG field and how to be a part of it, is there anyone else you can suggest that I talk to?</h3>
            <p>I'd highly recommend using your resources, like ArtStation, Instagram, etc. and just reach out to people and ask them about their field, get some critique, and ask the respective challenges that come with their field. There's no magic
                button to getting a job, but getting inside tips increase your odds on the whole.</p>
